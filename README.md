# Flight-Prediction-EDA-Feature-Engineeering

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on a dataset related to flight predictions. There are two dataset: Training data and Test data. The goal of this project is to gain insights into the data through visualizations and statistical analysis, as well as to engineer new features that could improve predictive models.

# Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Format: Excel

# Libraries Used
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# Key Steps
**Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the dataset using visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.
**Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the dataset.
**Label Encoding:** Used to convert categorical variables into numerical format.<

# Result
**Point 1:** Overview of the distribution of various features such as departure delays, arrival delays, flight durations, etc.
**Point 2:** Trends and patterns over time, such as the busiest times of day, week, or year for flights. 
**Point 3:** Analysis of flight routes, including the most common routes and destinations.

# Future Work
Build predictive models to forecast flight delays or cancellations.
Explore additional datasets to incorporate more features and improve model performance.
